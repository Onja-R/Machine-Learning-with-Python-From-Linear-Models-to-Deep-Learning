The archive contains the following python files:
- kmeans where we have implemented a baseline using the K-means algorithm
- naive_em.py where you will implement a first version of the EM algorithm (tabs 3-4)
- em.py where you will build a mixture model for collaborative filtering (tabs 7-8)
- common.py where you will implement the common functions for all models (tab 5)
- main.py where you will write code to answer the questions for this project
- test.py where you will write code to test your implementation of EM for a given test case 

Additionnally, you are provided with the following data files:

- toy_data.txt a 2D dataset that you will work with in tabs 2-5
- netflix_incomplete.txt the netflix dataset with missing entries to be completed
- netflix_complete.txt the netflix dataset with missing entries completed
- test_incomplete.txt a test dataset to test for you to test your code against our implementation
- test_complete.txt a test dataset to test for you to test your code against our implementation
- test_solutions.txt a test dataset to test for you to test your code against our implementation 

Tip: Throughout the whole online grading system, you can assume the NumPy python library is already imported as np. In some problems you will also have access to other functions you've already implemented. Look out for the "Available Functions" Tip before the codebox, as you did in the previous projects.

This project will unfold both on MITx and on your local machine. However, we encourage you to first implement the functions locally and run them to validate basic functionality. Think of the online graders as a submission box to submit your code when it is ready. You should not have to use the online graders to debug your code.
